### GOAL 

> Create a native app that queries the google api for business locations and
puts them on a map with pins.
The app should work as an expo snack for easier review.

#### Instructions

- Within this repo you will find an expo app.


- The app contain several errors,
so you will need to do some debugging to ensure is working correctly.

- The app should have an input that accepts a users query.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `coffee`, a map of every coffee shop
 near them is displayed. You can hard code the gps location if you like.

- When the user taps on a pin display detailed information about that business
in a new screen. Use [react navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).
- *Example*: If a user is viewing a map of coffee shops near them,
they can tap on one of them to see basic info about the business.

- Users should be able to "favorite" a business and have it persisted on the phone.

- Provide a favorites screen to display favorited movies.

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please send us back a link to a git repo with the completed code challenge. 

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Snack.
